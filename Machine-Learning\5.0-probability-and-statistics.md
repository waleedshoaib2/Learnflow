## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Probability

**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It's a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

*   **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, when flipping a coin, the sample space is `{Heads, Tails}`.
*   **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space.  For example, getting `Heads` when flipping a coin.
*   **Probability of an Event:**  P(E) = Number of outcomes in E / Number of outcomes in S, assuming all outcomes are equally likely.

**Example:**  What is the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die?

*   Sample space: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
*   Event: E = {4}
*   P(E) = 1/6

**Types of Events:**

*   **Independent Events:** The outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event.  Example: Flipping a coin twice.
*   **Dependent Events:** The outcome of one event affects the outcome of another event. Example: Drawing cards from a deck without replacement.
*   **Mutually Exclusive Events:** Events that cannot occur at the same time. Example: Rolling a 1 and a 2 on a single die roll.

**Key Formulas:**

*   **P(A or B) (for mutually exclusive events):** P(A) + P(B)
*   **P(A and B) (for independent events):** P(A) * P(B)
*   **Conditional Probability: P(A|B):**  The probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

### 2.2 Random Variables and Probability Distributions

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.

*   **Discrete Random Variable:** A variable that can only take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values.  Example: Number of heads in 3 coin flips (0, 1, 2, or 3).
*   **Continuous Random Variable:** A variable that can take on any value within a given range. Example: Height of a person.

A **probability distribution** describes the probabilities of all possible values of a random variable.

**Common Probability Distributions:**

*   **Bernoulli Distribution:** Models the probability of success or failure in a single trial.
*   **Binomial Distribution:** Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
*   **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
*   **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):**  A continuous distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve.  It's defined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

```

### 2.3 Statistics

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

**Descriptive Statistics:** Methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset.

*   **Measures of Central Tendency:**
    *   **Mean:** The average value of a dataset.
    *   **Median:** The middle value of a dataset when sorted.
    *   **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
*   **Measures of Dispersion (Variability):**
    *   **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
    *   **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean.
    *   **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance. It measures the spread of data around the mean.

**Inferential Statistics:** Methods for drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data.

*   **Hypothesis Testing:**  A statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis.
    *   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** A statement about the population that we are trying to disprove.
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.
    *   **P-value:** The probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.  A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
*   **Confidence Intervals:**  A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).

>   **Important Note:** Correlation does not imply causation.  Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one causes the other. There may be other confounding factors at play.

## 3. Practical Implementation

We'll use Python with the `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Statsmodels` libraries for practical implementation.

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Sample Data
data = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35])

# Descriptive Statistics
mean = np.mean(data)
median = np.median(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean}")       # Output: Mean: 21.5
print(f"Median: {median}")   # Output: Median: 21.0
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")  # Output: Standard Deviation: 7.762604498847341
```

**Example: Hypothesis Testing (T-test)**

Let's test the hypothesis that the mean of the data is different from 20.

```python
# One-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(data, 20)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic}") # Output: T-statistic: 0.6123724356957946
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")       # Output: P-value: 0.5558343155063826

alpha = 0.05 # Significance level

if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis") #Output: Fail to reject the null hypothesis
```

**Example: Linear Regression**

```python
# Sample Data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Linear Regression using Statsmodels
model = smf.ols('y ~ x', data={'x': x, 'y': y})
results = model.fit()

print(results.summary())
```

**Common Use Cases:**

*   **A/B Testing:** Determining which version of a website or application performs better.
*   **Fraud Detection:** Identifying fraudulent transactions.
*   **Medical Diagnosis:** Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and test results.
*   **Risk Management:** Assessing and managing financial risks.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Predicting when equipment is likely to fail.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Clearly define your research question.**
*   **Collect high-quality data.**
*   **Choose appropriate statistical methods.**
*   **Interpret results cautiously.**
*   **Visualize your data to gain insights.**

## 4. Advanced Topics

### 4.1 Bayesian Statistics

**Bayesian statistics** is a statistical approach that updates prior beliefs based on observed evidence. It uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of a hypothesis given the data.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / P(D)

Where:

*   P(H|D) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the data D.
*   P(D|H) is the likelihood of observing the data D given the hypothesis H.
*   P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
*   P(D) is the probability of the data D.

**Example:**  Consider a medical test for a rare disease. The test is 99% accurate, meaning that it correctly identifies 99% of people who have the disease and correctly identifies 99% of people who do not have the disease.  The disease affects 0.1% of the population. If a person tests positive, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?

```python
# Probabilities
P_Disease = 0.001    # Prior probability of having the disease
P_NoDisease = 0.999  # Prior probability of not having the disease
P_Positive_Given_Disease = 0.99  # Probability of testing positive given you have the disease (sensitivity)
P_Negative_Given_NoDisease = 0.99 # Probability of testing negative given you don't have the disease (specificity)

# Calculate probability of testing positive
P_Positive = (P_Positive_Given_Disease * P_Disease) + ((1 - P_Negative_Given_NoDisease) * P_NoDisease)

# Calculate posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem
P_Disease_Given_Positive = (P_Positive_Given_Disease * P_Disease) / P_Positive

print(f"Probability of having the disease given a positive test: {P_Disease_Given_Positive}") # Output: Probability of having the disease given a positive test: 0.09016393442622951
```

Even though the test is 99% accurate, the probability of having the disease given a positive test is only about 9%, because the disease is so rare.

### 4.2 Time Series Analysis

**Time series analysis** is a statistical method for analyzing data points indexed in time order.  It's used to identify patterns, forecast future values, and understand the underlying processes that generate the data.

**Common Time Series Models:**

*   **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):**  A class of models that captures the correlation between past and present values in a time series.
*   **Exponential Smoothing:** A class of models that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.

### 4.3 Survival Analysis

**Survival analysis** is a statistical method for analyzing the time until an event occurs. It's commonly used in medical research to analyze the time until a patient dies or experiences a specific outcome.

**Common Survival Analysis Techniques:**

*   **Kaplan-Meier Estimator:**  A non-parametric method for estimating the survival function.
*   **Cox Proportional Hazards Model:** A semi-parametric method for analyzing the relationship between covariates and survival time.

### 4.4 Common Challenges and Solutions

*   **Missing Data:**  Impute missing values using techniques like mean imputation, median imputation, or regression imputation.
*   **Outliers:**  Identify and handle outliers using techniques like Z-score analysis or IQR analysis.  Consider whether the outliers are genuine data points or errors.
*   **Non-Normality:**  Transform data to achieve normality using techniques like logarithmic transformation or Box-Cox transformation.  Consider using non-parametric statistical tests if normality cannot be achieved.
*   **Overfitting:**  Use techniques like cross-validation or regularization to prevent overfitting in machine learning models.

### 4.5 Performance Considerations

*   **Algorithm Selection:**  Choose algorithms that are appropriate for the size and structure of your data.
*   **Data Preprocessing:**  Optimize data preprocessing steps to improve performance.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Use parallel processing to speed up computations.
*   **Memory Management:**  Optimize memory management to avoid memory errors.

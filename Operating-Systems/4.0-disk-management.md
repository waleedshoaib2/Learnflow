## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Key Theoretical Foundations

Disk management revolves around the following fundamental concepts:

*   **Physical Disk:** The physical storage device itself (e.g., HDD, SSD, NVMe).
*   **Partition:** A logical division of a physical disk, treated as an independent unit.  A disk can have one or more partitions.
*   **Volume:** A logical storage unit that can span multiple partitions or even multiple disks. It's presented to the operating system as a single drive.  This isn't always a direct 1:1 mapping with a partition.  For instance, RAID volumes.
*   **File System:** A method of organizing and storing files on a storage device (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4, XFS). It provides the structure and rules for how data is written, read, and accessed.
*   **Mount Point:** A directory in the file system where a volume is attached (e.g., `C:\` on Windows, `/mnt/data` on Linux).
*   **Disk Controller:** The hardware interface that connects the physical disk to the computer's motherboard (e.g., SATA, IDE, SCSI, NVMe).
*   **Master Boot Record (MBR):**  An older partitioning scheme that supports a limited number of primary partitions (typically 4).
*   **GUID Partition Table (GPT):** A more modern partitioning scheme that supports a larger number of partitions and larger disk sizes than MBR.

### 2.2 Important Terminology

| Term            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Formatting       | The process of preparing a partition for use by a specific file system. This involves creating the necessary data structures for storing files and directories.             |
| Partitioning     | Dividing a physical disk into one or more logical partitions.                                                                                                           |
| Mounting         | Attaching a volume to a directory in the file system, making its contents accessible.                                                                                       |
| Unmounting       | Detaching a volume from a directory in the file system.                                                                                                                 |
| Disk Quota      | Limits on the amount of disk space that a user or group can consume.                                                                                                    |
| Disk Defragmentation | Reorganizing files on a disk to reduce fragmentation and improve performance. Less relevant with SSDs.                                                                 |
| RAID             | Redundant Array of Independent Disks; a storage technology that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit for performance and/or data redundancy.       |

### 2.3 Fundamental Principles

*   **Partitioning Scheme:** Choosing between MBR and GPT partitioning schemes depends on disk size, operating system compatibility, and the number of partitions required. GPT is generally preferred for newer systems and disks larger than 2TB.
*   **File System Selection:** The choice of file system depends on the operating system, compatibility requirements, and desired features (e.g., journaling, encryption, quotas).
*   **Disk Space Allocation:** Planning the size and location of partitions is crucial for optimizing performance and preventing future storage limitations. Consider the needs of the operating system, applications, and user data.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regularly backing up important data is essential for protecting against data loss due to hardware failure, software corruption, or accidental deletion.
*   **Disk Monitoring:** Monitoring disk health and performance is important for identifying potential problems and preventing system downtime.

### 2.4 Visual Explanations

Consider the following diagram illustrating disk partitioning:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|              Physical Disk (e.g., 1TB)            |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  Partition 1 (e.g., 100GB, File System: NTFS)    |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  Partition 2 (e.g., 500GB, File System: ext4)     |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  Partition 3 (e.g., 400GB, File System: XFS)      |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

In this example, a 1TB physical disk is divided into three partitions, each formatted with a different file system. Each partition can then be mounted to a directory, making it accessible to the operating system.

## 3. Practical Implementation

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Examples

**Example 1: Creating a Partition on Windows**

1.  Open Disk Management: Search for "Disk Management" in the Windows Start menu and open the application.
2.  Identify the Unallocated Space: Locate the physical disk with unallocated space. This will appear as a dark gray bar.
3.  Create a New Simple Volume: Right-click on the unallocated space and select "New Simple Volume...".
4.  Follow the Wizard: A wizard will guide you through the process of specifying the partition size, assigning a drive letter, selecting a file system (e.g., NTFS), and setting a volume label.
5.  Click "Finish": Once you have completed the wizard, the new partition will be created and formatted.

**Example 2: Creating a Partition on Linux (using `fdisk`)**

1.  Open a Terminal: Launch a terminal emulator.
2.  Identify the Disk: Use the `lsblk` command to list available block devices (disks). Identify the disk you want to partition (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).
3.  Run `fdisk`: Execute the command `sudo fdisk /dev/sdb` (replace `/dev/sdb` with the correct disk identifier).
4.  Create a New Partition: Use the `n` command to create a new partition.
5.  Specify Partition Type: Choose either a primary (`p`) or extended (`e`) partition.
6.  Specify Partition Number: Enter the partition number (e.g., `1`).
7.  Specify First and Last Sector: Accept the default values for the first sector, and enter the size of the partition (e.g., `+100G` for 100GB).
8.  Set Partition Type: Use the `t` command to set the partition type (e.g., `83` for Linux).
9.  Write Changes to Disk: Use the `w` command to write the changes to the disk.  **This will erase data on the selected disk!**
10. Format the Partition: Use the `mkfs` command to format the partition with a file system (e.g., `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`).
11. Mount the Partition: Create a mount point (e.g., `sudo mkdir /mnt/data`) and mount the partition (e.g., `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data`).

```bash
# Example using fdisk
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

# Commands within fdisk:
# n  (new partition)
# p  (primary)
# 1  (partition number)
# <enter> (first sector, default)
# +100G (last sector, 100GB size)
# t  (change partition type)
# 83 (Linux partition)
# w  (write changes to disk)

# Format the partition
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

# Create a mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/data

# Mount the partition
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
```

**Example 3: Formatting a Partition**

*   **Windows:** Right-click on the partition in Disk Management and select "Format...". Choose the file system and volume label, and click "Start".
*   **Linux:** Use the `mkfs` command (e.g., `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`).

### 3.2 Code Snippets with Explanations

```python
# Python example (requires elevated privileges on some OSs)
# This example provides a conceptual overview and might require OS-specific libraries.

import os

def get_disk_space(path):
  """Returns disk space usage statistics (total, used, free) in bytes."""
  total, used, free = os.statvfs(path)
  return total * os.f_frsize, used * os.f_frsize, free * os.f_frsize

# Example usage
total, used, free = get_disk_space("/") # Root directory
print(f"Total space: {total / (1024**3):.2f} GB")
print(f"Used space: {used / (1024**3):.2f} GB")
print(f"Free space: {free / (1024**3):.2f} GB")
```

**Explanation:**

*   This Python code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve disk space usage information for a specified path.
*   It uses the `os.statvfs()` function to obtain disk statistics.
*   The results are then converted to gigabytes for easier readability.
*   Note that obtaining disk information often requires elevated privileges (e.g., administrator or root) on some operating systems.

### 3.3 Common Use Cases

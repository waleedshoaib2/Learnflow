# 3.2 CPU Scheduling: A Comprehensive Tutorial

## 1. Introduction

This tutorial dives into the critical topic of **CPU Scheduling**, a fundamental aspect of operating systems. CPU scheduling is the process of determining which process in the ready queue should be allocated the CPU at any given time. Efficient CPU scheduling is crucial for maximizing CPU utilization, minimizing response time, and achieving overall system efficiency.

**Why it's important:**

*   **Improved System Performance:** Proper scheduling algorithms can significantly reduce waiting times and improve throughput.
*   **Fairness:** Ensures that no process is starved of CPU time.
*   **Responsiveness:** Provides timely responses to user requests.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Optimizes the use of the CPU, one of the most expensive system resources.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Basic understanding of operating system concepts, especially processes, threads, and process states (ready, running, waiting).
*   Familiarity with data structures like queues.

**Learning objectives:**

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

*   Explain the core concepts of CPU scheduling.
*   Describe and compare different CPU scheduling algorithms.
*   Implement basic CPU scheduling algorithms in code.
*   Analyze the performance of different scheduling algorithms.
*   Understand the challenges of CPU scheduling in real-world systems.

## 2. Core Concepts

### Key Theoretical Foundations

CPU scheduling aims to maximize CPU utilization while minimizing factors like waiting time, turnaround time, and response time. The key challenge lies in balancing these conflicting goals while ensuring fairness among processes.

### Important Terminology

*   **CPU Burst:** The amount of time a process uses the CPU before requiring I/O or other resources.
*   **I/O Burst:** The amount of time a process spends waiting for I/O operations to complete.
*   **Arrival Time:** The time at which a process enters the ready queue.
*   **Burst Time:** The total amount of CPU time a process requires.
*   **Completion Time:** The time at which a process finishes its execution.
*   **Turnaround Time:** The time elapsed from arrival to completion (Completion Time - Arrival Time).
*   **Waiting Time:** The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue (Turnaround Time - Burst Time).
*   **Response Time:** The time from when a request is submitted until the first response is produced (relevant in interactive systems).
*   **Throughput:** The number of processes completed per unit of time.
*   **CPU Utilization:** The percentage of time the CPU is busy executing processes.
*   **Preemptive Scheduling:** The CPU can be taken away from a running process.
*   **Non-Preemptive Scheduling:** The CPU cannot be taken away from a running process; it runs until completion or voluntarily releases the CPU.
*   **Dispatcher:** The module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler; this involves switching context, switching to user mode, and jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program.

### Fundamental Principles

The CPU scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them. The scheduling decisions may take place when a process:

1.  Switches from running to waiting state (e.g., I/O request).
2.  Switches from running to ready state (e.g., interrupt occurs).
3.  Switches from waiting to ready state (e.g., I/O completion).
4.  Terminates.

In cases 1 and 4, the scheduling scheme is *non-preemptive* or *cooperative*. Otherwise, it is *preemptive*.

### Visual Explanations

Here are some diagrams to illustrate the concepts:

**Process State Diagram:**

    B --> C{Running};
    C --> D{Waiting};
    D --> B;
    C --> E(Terminated);
    C --> B;  % Preemption
```

**Gantt Chart (for visualizing scheduling):**

Let's say we have 3 processes: P1, P2, and P3, and they were scheduled with FCFS.
```
| P1 | P2 | P3 |
0   5   8   16
```

## 3. Practical Implementation

This section will explore common CPU scheduling algorithms.

### Step-by-Step Examples

We will demonstrate the following scheduling algorithms:

1.  **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
2.  **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3.  **Priority Scheduling**
4.  **Round Robin (RR)**

Let's assume we have the following processes with their arrival times and burst times:

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Priority |
|---------|--------------|------------|----------|
| P1      | 0            | 5          | 3        |
| P2      | 1            | 3          | 1        |
| P3      | 2            | 8          | 4        |
| P4      | 3            | 6          | 2        |

(Lower number = higher priority)

### Code Snippets with Explanations

We'll use Python to simulate these algorithms for demonstration purposes.  This example is simplified and doesn't represent a real-time operating system scheduler.

**1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**

```python
def fcfs(processes):
    """Simulates the FCFS scheduling algorithm."""
    processes.sort(key=lambda x: x['arrival_time']) # Sort by arrival time
    current_time = 0
    completion_times = {}
    waiting_times = {}
    turnaround_times = {}

    for process in processes:
        if current_time < process['arrival_time']:
            current_time = process['arrival_time']
        start_time = current_time
        current_time += process['burst_time']
        completion_times[process['name']] = current_time
        turnaround_times[process['name']] = current_time - process['arrival_time']
        waiting_times[process['name']] = turnaround_times[process['name']] - process['burst_time']

    return completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times


processes = [
    {'name': 'P1', 'arrival_time': 0, 'burst_time': 5, 'priority': 3},
    {'name': 'P2', 'arrival_time': 1, 'burst_time': 3, 'priority': 1},
    {'name': 'P3', 'arrival_time': 2, 'burst_time': 8, 'priority': 4},
    {'name': 'P4', 'arrival_time': 3, 'burst_time': 6, 'priority': 2}
]

completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times = fcfs(processes)

print("FCFS Scheduling:")
print("Completion Times:", completion_times)
print("Turnaround Times:", turnaround_times)
print("Waiting Times:", waiting_times)
```

**Explanation:**

*   We sort the processes based on their `arrival_time`.
*   `current_time` tracks the current time in the simulation.
*   We iterate through the sorted processes, updating `current_time` to account for each process's `burst_time`.
*   `completion_time`, `turnaround_time`, and `waiting_time` are calculated for each process.

**2. Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-Preemptive**

```python
def sjf_non_preemptive(processes):
    """Simulates the SJF (non-preemptive) scheduling algorithm."""
    current_time = 0
    completion_times = {}
    waiting_times = {}
    turnaround_times = {}
    remaining_processes = processes[:]  # Create a copy of the process list

    while remaining_processes:
        available_processes = [p for p in remaining_processes if p['arrival_time'] <= current_time]

        if not available_processes:
            current_time += 1
            continue

        # Select the process with the shortest burst time among available processes
        shortest_process = min(available_processes, key=lambda x: x['burst_time'])

        start_time = current_time
        current_time += shortest_process['burst_time']
        completion_times[shortest_process['name']] = current_time
        turnaround_times[shortest_process['name']] = current_time - shortest_process['arrival_time']
        waiting_times[shortest_process['name']] = turnaround_times[shortest_process['name']] - shortest_process['burst_time']

        remaining_processes.remove(shortest_process)

    return completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times

completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times = sjf_non_preemptive(processes)

print("\nSJF (Non-Preemptive) Scheduling:")
print("Completion Times:", completion_times)
print("Turnaround Times:", turnaround_times)
print("Waiting Times:", waiting_times)
```

**Explanation:**

*   We maintain a list of `remaining_processes`.
*   In each iteration, we find the `available_processes` that have arrived by the `current_time`.
*   The process with the shortest `burst_time` among the available processes is selected.
*   `completion_time`, `turnaround_time`, and `waiting_time` are calculated.

**3. Priority Scheduling - Non-Preemptive**

```python
def priority_non_preemptive(processes):
    """Simulates the Priority (non-preemptive) scheduling algorithm."""
    current_time = 0
    completion_times = {}
    waiting_times = {}
    turnaround_times = {}
    remaining_processes = processes[:]

    while remaining_processes:
        available_processes = [p for p in remaining_processes if p['arrival_time'] <= current_time]

        if not available_processes:
            current_time += 1
            continue

        # Select the process with the highest priority (smallest priority number)
        highest_priority_process = min(available_processes, key=lambda x: x['priority'])

        start_time = current_time
        current_time += highest_priority_process['burst_time']
        completion_times[highest_priority_process['name']] = current_time
        turnaround_times[highest_priority_process['name']] = current_time - highest_priority_process['arrival_time']
        waiting_times[highest_priority_process['name']] = turnaround_times[highest_priority_process['name']] - highest_priority_process['burst_time']

        remaining_processes.remove(highest_priority_process)

    return completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times

completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times = priority_non_preemptive(processes)

print("\nPriority (Non-Preemptive) Scheduling:")
print("Completion Times:", completion_times)
print("Turnaround Times:", turnaround_times)
print("Waiting Times:", waiting_times)
```

**Explanation:**

*   Similar to SJF, but prioritizes processes based on their `priority` (lower number means higher priority).

**4. Round Robin (RR)**

```python
def round_robin(processes, time_quantum):
    """Simulates the Round Robin scheduling algorithm."""
    current_time = 0
    completion_times = {}
    waiting_times = {}
    turnaround_times = {}
    remaining_processes = processes[:]  # Make a copy
    ready_queue = []

    # Initialize the ready queue with processes that have arrived
    ready_queue.extend([p for p in remaining_processes if p['arrival_time'] <= current_time])
    remaining_processes = [p for p in remaining_processes if p not in ready_queue]

    while ready_queue or remaining_processes:

        if not ready_queue:  # If the queue is empty and there are remaining processes, advance time
            current_time += 1
            ready_queue.extend([p for p in remaining_processes if p['arrival_time'] <= current_time])
            remaining_processes = [p for p in remaining_processes if p not in ready_queue]
            continue

        process = ready_queue.pop(0)

        # Determine execution time
        execution_time = min(time_quantum, process['burst_time'])

        # Update burst time and current time
        process['burst_time'] -= execution_time
        current_time += execution_time

        # Check if process is completed
        if process['burst_time'] == 0:
            completion_times[process['name']] = current_time
            turnaround_times[process['name']] = current_time - process['arrival_time']
            waiting_times[process['name']] = turnaround_times[process['name']] - processes[processes.index(next(item for item in processes if item["name"] == process['name']))]['burst_time']  # Use the *original* burst time for waiting time calculation
        else:
            # Add process to the end of the queue
            ready_queue.append(process)

        # Add newly arrived processes to ready queue
        ready_queue.extend([p for p in remaining_processes if p['arrival_time'] <= current_time])
        remaining_processes = [p for p in remaining_processes if p not in ready_queue])

    return completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times

time_quantum = 2  # Define the time quantum
completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times = round_robin(processes, time_quantum)

print("\nRound Robin Scheduling (Time Quantum = {}):".format(time_quantum))
print("Completion Times:", completion_times)
print("Turnaround Times:", turnaround_times)
print("Waiting Times:", waiting_times)
```

**Explanation:**

*   Processes are executed in a cyclical manner, each for a short time slice called the `time_quantum`.
*   If a process's `burst_time` is greater than the `time_quantum`, it is preempted and added back to the end of the ready queue.

### Common Use Cases

*   **FCFS:** Simple to implement but can lead to long waiting times, especially if a long process arrives early. Good for batch processing.
*   **SJF:** Optimal in terms of minimizing average waiting time, but requires knowing the burst time in advance (which is often not possible).
*   **Priority Scheduling:** Useful for giving preference to important processes, but can lead to starvation of low-priority processes.
*   **Round Robin:** Fair and responsive, suitable for interactive systems.  The choice of `time_quantum` is crucial; a small quantum leads to frequent context switches, while a large quantum approaches FCFS.

### Best Practices

*   Choose the scheduling algorithm that best suits the specific system requirements.
*   Consider using a combination of scheduling algorithms for different types of processes.
*   Implement aging mechanisms to prevent starvation in priority scheduling.  Aging gradually increases the priority of processes that have been waiting for a long time.
*   Continuously monitor and tune the scheduling algorithm to optimize performance.

## 4. Advanced Topics

### Advanced Techniques

*   **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:** Divides the ready queue into multiple queues with different priorities. Each queue can use a different scheduling algorithm.
*   **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:** Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, but allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior. For example, a process that uses too much CPU time might be moved to a lower-priority queue.
*   **Real-Time Scheduling:** Designed for systems with strict timing requirements (e.g., industrial control systems, multimedia applications).  Examples include Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).
*   **Fair-Share Scheduling:** Guarantees that each user (or group of users) receives a fair share of CPU time.

### Real-World Applications

*   **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows, macOS use a combination of scheduling algorithms.  Linux, for example, uses a Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).

*   **Convoy Effect:** A long process blocks many short processes in FCFS. Solution: Use SJF or RR.
*   **Overhead:** Frequent context switches can reduce CPU utilization. Solution: Choose an appropriate time quantum in RR, avoid unnecessary preemption.
*   **Predicting Burst Times:** SJF requires knowing burst times, which is often not possible.  Solution: Estimate burst times based on past behavior.

### Performance Considerations

    current_time = 0
    completion_times = {}
    waiting_times = {}
    turnaround_times = {}
    remaining_processes = processes[:]
    remaining_burst_times = {p['name']: p['burst_time'] for p in processes} # Store remaining burst times

    while remaining_processes:

        if not available_processes:
            current_time += 1
            continue

        # Select the process with the shortest remaining burst time
        shortest_process = min(available_processes, key=lambda x: remaining_burst_times[x['name']])

        # Execute the process for one unit of time
        remaining_burst_times[shortest_process['name']] -= 1

        # Check if process is completed
        if remaining_burst_times[shortest_process['name']] == 0:
            completion_times[shortest_process['name']] = current_time
            turnaround_times[shortest_process['name']] = current_time - shortest_process['arrival_time']
            waiting_times[shortest_process['name']] = turnaround_times[shortest_process['name']] - processes[processes.index(next(item for item in processes if item["name"] == shortest_process['name']))]['burst_time'] # Use original burst time for calculation
            remaining_processes.remove(shortest_process)



    return completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times


completion_times, turnaround_times, waiting_times = srtf(processes)

print("\nSRTF (Preemptive SJF) Scheduling:")

```

### Challenge Exercises with Hints

1.  **Implement Aging in Priority Scheduling:** Modify the priority scheduling algorithm to implement aging. Gradually increase the priority of processes that have been waiting in the ready queue for a long time. *Hint: Keep track of the waiting time of each process and periodically increase its priority.*
2. **Fairness Metric:** Calculate a "fairness" metric for a scheduling algorithm.  Jain's Fairness Index is a commonly used metric:  `Fairness = (sum(throughput))^2 / (n * sum(throughput^2))`, where n is the number of processes. The closer the fairness value is to 1, the fairer the algorithm is. *Hint: calculate the throughput for each process.*

### Project Ideas for Practice

3.  **Cloud Resource Scheduler:**  Build a cloud resource scheduler that allocates virtual machines (VMs) to users based on their resource requirements and priority.

### Sample Solutions and Explanations

Sample solutions for Level 1 and Level 2 exercises are provided in Section 3 and the SRTF implementation is included in this section. Detailed explanations are provided alongside the code.

### Common Mistakes to Watch For

*   **Incorrect Calculation of Waiting Time:**  Make sure to subtract the burst time from the turnaround time to calculate the waiting time.  Also, remember to use the *original* burst time, particularly when using preemptive algorithms.
*   **Starvation:**  Ensure that no process is starved of CPU time. Implement aging if necessary.
*   **Ignoring Arrival Times:**  Processes may arrive at different times. Make sure to account for arrival times when scheduling.
*   **Incorrect Preemption Logic:**  In preemptive algorithms, ensure that preemption is handled correctly and that the preempted process's state is preserved.
*   **Off-by-One Errors:** Pay close attention to boundary conditions and off-by-one errors, especially when dealing with time quanta and remaining burst times.

*   **Logging:** Add logging statements to your code to track the execution flow and identify potential issues.
*   **Debugging Tools:**  Use debugging tools to step through your code and inspect variables.
*   **Print Statements:**  Use print statements to display the values of variables and the state of your system.
*   **Divide and Conquer:**  Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Performance Bottlenecks

*   **Context Switching Overhead:**  Measure the context switching overhead and try to minimize it.
*   **Algorithm Complexity:**  Analyze the time complexity of your scheduling algorithm and identify potential bottlenecks.
*   **Resource Contention:**  Identify processes that are competing for the same resources and try to reduce contention.

### Error Messages and Their Meaning

*   **Segmentation Fault:**  A memory access violation.  Check for pointer errors or array out-of-bounds errors.
*   **Divide-by-Zero Error:**  An attempt to divide by zero.  Check for potential division-by-zero errors in your code.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The system has run out of resources, such as memory or file handles. Close unused resources and try to optimize your code.

### Edge Cases to Consider

*   **Empty Ready Queue:**  Handle the case where the ready queue is empty.
*   **Processes with Zero Burst Time:**  Handle the case where a process has a burst time of zero.
*   **Processes Arriving Simultaneously:**  Handle the case where multiple processes arrive at the same time.

### Tools and Techniques for Diagnosis

*   **System Monitoring Tools:**  Use system monitoring tools, such as `top` (Linux) or `Task Manager` (Windows), to monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and process activity.
*   **Profiling Tools:**  Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.  Examples include `gprof` (Linux) and `Visual Studio Profiler` (Windows).

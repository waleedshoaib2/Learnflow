## üîß STEP 1: Understand the Goal

We want to **train a model** that can **predict** a number (e.g., house price) using several features (e.g., size, number of rooms). The formula for linear regression is:

$$
\hat{y} = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + \dots + x_k w_k + b
$$

* $\hat{y}$: predicted output
* $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$: input features
* $w_1, w_2, ..., w_k$: weights for each feature
* $b$: bias (a constant added to the result)

---

## üì§ STEP 2: Forward Pass (Make Predictions)

In the **forward pass**, we use current weights and bias to calculate predictions.

If we have a batch of data (e.g., 3 houses), and each has 4 features:

$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & x_{14} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & x_{24} \\
x_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33} & x_{34} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And weights:

$$
W =
\begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \\
w_2 \\
w_3 \\
w_4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Prediction is:

$$
\hat{y}_{\text{batch}} = X \cdot W + b
$$

---

## üìâ STEP 3: Calculate the Loss (How Wrong Are We?)

We compare the predictions $\hat{y}$ to the actual values $y$. One common loss function is **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

This gives us a number that tells us how far off our predictions are, on average.

---

## üîÅ STEP 4: Backward Pass (Calculate Gradients)

Now, we calculate how to **change the weights and bias** to reduce the error. This is called the **gradient** (slope of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias).

We use the **chain rule** from calculus:

1. **Gradient of the loss with respect to the prediction**:

   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} = -2 (y - \hat{y})
   $$

2. **Gradient of prediction with respect to weights**:

   $$
   \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial W} = X^T
   $$

3. **Gradient of loss with respect to weights**:

   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial W} = X^T \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}}
   $$

4. **Gradient of loss with respect to bias**:

   $$
   \frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = \text{sum of all values in } \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}}
   $$

---

## üß† STEP 5: Update the Model (Training)

Now we update the weights and bias using the gradients.

$$
w_i := w_i - \text{learning rate} \times \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_i}
$$

$$
b := b - \text{learning rate} \times \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
$$

We do this many times (iterations/epochs) until the model gets better.

---

## üß™ STEP 6: Evaluate the Model (Testing)

We split the dataset into:

* **Training set**: used to learn the weights.
* **Testing set**: used to check how well the model performs on unseen data.

To measure performance:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:

   $$
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
   $$

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:

   $$
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
   $$

The lower these values, the better your model is performing.

---

## üîç STEP 7: Understand the Model (Feature Importance)

Each **weight $w_i$** tells us how important a feature is:

* Large weight (positive or negative) = strong influence on prediction.
* Small weight = less impact.

We can plot the most important feature against the target to visually see the relationship.

---

## üö´ STEP 8: Understand Model Limitations

Linear regression only learns **straight-line relationships**. If the true pattern is curved or more complex, the model can't capture it.

For example:

* If the relationship between a feature and the output is curved, linear regression will still draw a straight line.
* This is called a **model limitation**.

To handle nonlinear relationships, we need more advanced models like **neural networks**.

## 2. Core Concepts

This section dives into the theoretical foundations of probability and statistics.

### Key Theoretical Foundations

*   **Probability:** The measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
*   **Statistics:** The science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Important Terminology

*   **Sample Space (Ω):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
*   **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space.
*   **Probability of an Event (P(E)):**  The measure of the likelihood that event E will occur.
*   **Random Variable (X):**  A variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
*   **Inferential Statistics:** Methods for drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data.
*   **Population:** The entire group of individuals or items of interest.
*   **Sample:** A subset of the population.
*   **Mean (μ or x̄):** The average of a set of numbers.
*   **Median:** The middle value in a sorted set of numbers.
*   **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a set of numbers.
*   **Variance (σ² or s²):** A measure of how spread out the data is from the mean.
*   **Standard Deviation (σ or s):** The square root of the variance, providing a more interpretable measure of spread.
*   **Probability Distribution:** A function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can assume.

### Fundamental Principles

*   **Axioms of Probability:**
    1.  0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1 for any event E.
    2.  P(Ω) = 1 (The probability of the sample space is 1).
    3.  If E1, E2, ... are mutually exclusive events, then P(E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ...) = P(E1) + P(E2) + ...

*   **Conditional Probability:**  The probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.  Denoted as P(A|B) and calculated as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) > 0.

*   **Bayes' Theorem:**  Describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.
    P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

*   **Independence:** Two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B), which implies P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B).

## 3. Practical Implementation

Now, let's apply these concepts with practical examples using Python.

### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example 1: Calculating Basic Probability**

Let's calculate the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die.

```python
# Sample space
sample_space = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Event: Rolling a 4
event = [4]

# Probability
probability = len(event) / len(sample_space)
print(f"The probability of rolling a 4 is: {probability}") # Output: The probability of rolling a 4 is: 0.16666666666666666
```

**Example 2: Calculating Conditional Probability**

Suppose you draw two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards *without replacement*. What is the probability that the second card is an Ace, given that the first card was an Ace?

```python
# Initial state
total_cards = 52
total_aces = 4

# Probability of the first card being an Ace
p_ace_first = total_aces / total_cards

# State after drawing one Ace
remaining_cards = total_cards - 1
remaining_aces = total_aces - 1

# Probability of the second card being an Ace, given the first was an Ace
p_ace_second_given_ace_first = remaining_aces / remaining_cards

print(f"P(Ace Second | Ace First) = {p_ace_second_given_ace_first}")  # Output: P(Ace Second | Ace First) = 0.058823529411764705
```

**Example 3: Calculating Descriptive Statistics**

```python
import numpy as np

data = [10, 15, 12, 18, 20, 14]

# Calculate mean
mean = np.mean(data)
print(f"Mean: {mean}") # Output: Mean: 14.833333333333334

# Calculate median
median = np.median(data)
print(f"Median: {median}") # Output: Median: 14.5

# Calculate standard deviation
std_dev = np.std(data)
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}") # Output: Standard Deviation: 3.4318768810343656

# Calculate variance
variance = np.var(data)
print(f"Variance: {variance}") # Output: Variance: 11.777777777777779
```

### Common Use Cases

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Probability

**Definition:** Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

**Important Terminology:**

*   **Experiment:** A process with well-defined possible outcomes.
*   **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  Example: Flipping a coin, S = {Heads, Tails}.
*   **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space. Example: Getting Heads when flipping a coin, E = {Heads}.
*   **Probability of an Event (P(E)):** The ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely. `P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes`.

**Fundamental Principles:**

*   **Axioms of Probability:**
    *   `0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1` for any event E.
    *   `P(S) = 1` (The probability of the sample space is 1).
    *   If events `E1`, `E2`, ... are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time), then `P(E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ...) = P(E1) + P(E2) + ...`.
*   **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event E occurring given that another event F has already occurred.  `P(E|F) = P(E ∩ F) / P(F)` where `P(F) > 0`.
*   **Independence:** Two events E and F are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.  `P(E|F) = P(E)` or `P(E ∩ F) = P(E) * P(F)`.
*   **Bayes' Theorem:**  Describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. `P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)`

**Visual Explanation:**

Imagine a Venn diagram.  The sample space (S) is represented by a rectangle. Events (E and F) are represented by circles within the rectangle. The intersection of the circles represents `E ∩ F` (E and F both occur).

### 2.2 Statistics

**Definition:** Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

**Important Terminology:**

*   **Population:** The entire group of individuals or objects of interest.
*   **Sample:** A subset of the population.
*   **Parameter:** A numerical characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean, population standard deviation).
*   **Statistic:** A numerical characteristic of a sample (e.g., sample mean, sample standard deviation).
*   **Variable:** A characteristic that can vary from one individual or object to another.
    *   **Categorical Variable:** A variable that takes on values that are names or labels (e.g., color, gender).
    *   **Numerical Variable:** A variable that takes on values that are numbers (e.g., age, height).
        *   **Discrete Variable:** A numerical variable that can only take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values (e.g., number of children).
        *   **Continuous Variable:** A numerical variable that can take on any value within a given range (e.g., height, temperature).

**Fundamental Principles:**

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Methods for summarizing and describing data.  Examples include:
    *   **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, median, mode.
    *   **Measures of Dispersion:** Variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Histograms, scatter plots, box plots.
*   **Inferential Statistics:** Methods for making inferences about a population based on a sample.  Examples include:
    *   **Hypothesis Testing:** A procedure for testing a claim about a population.
    *   **Confidence Intervals:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter.
    *   **Regression Analysis:** A method for modeling the relationship between two or more variables.

**Relationship Between Probability and Statistics:**

Probability provides the theoretical foundation for statistics.  Statistical inference uses probability to make generalizations from samples to populations.  For example, hypothesis testing relies on calculating the probability of observing the sample data under a specific hypothesis.

### 2.3 Probability Distributions

A probability distribution describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. It assigns a probability to each possible value of a random variable.

**Types of Probability Distributions:**

*   **Discrete Probability Distributions:**
    *   **Bernoulli Distribution:** Models the probability of success or failure in a single trial.
        *   Parameters: `p` (probability of success)
        *   Example: Flipping a coin once.
    *   **Binomial Distribution:** Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
        *   Parameters: `n` (number of trials), `p` (probability of success)
        *   Example: Number of heads in 10 coin flips.
    *   **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
        *   Parameters: `λ` (average rate of events)
        *   Example: Number of customers arriving at a store in an hour.

*   **Continuous Probability Distributions:**
    *   **Normal Distribution:**  A symmetrical bell-shaped distribution, often observed in natural phenomena. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution.
        *   Parameters: `μ` (mean), `σ` (standard deviation)
        *   Example: Heights of adults.
    *   **Exponential Distribution:** Models the time until an event occurs.
        *   Parameters: `λ` (rate parameter)
        *   Example: Time until a light bulb fails.
    *   **Uniform Distribution:** All values within a given range are equally likely.
        *   Parameters: `a` (minimum value), `b` (maximum value)
        *   Example: Random number generator.

## 3. Practical Implementation

### 3.1 Calculating Probabilities

**Example 1: Rolling a Fair Die**

What is the probability of rolling a 4?

```python
# Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
# Event: Rolling a 4

favorable_outcomes = 1
total_outcomes = 6
probability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes
print(f"Probability of rolling a 4: {probability}")  # Output: Probability of rolling a 4: 0.16666666666666666
```

**Example 2: Conditional Probability**

You have two bags. Bag 1 contains 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. Bag 2 contains 2 red balls and 3 blue balls. You randomly pick a bag and then randomly pick a ball.  Given that you picked a red ball, what is the probability that you picked from Bag 1?

```python
# Let A be the event of picking from Bag 1
# Let B be the event of picking a red ball

# P(A) = 0.5 (probability of picking Bag 1)
# P(B|A) = 3/5 (probability of picking a red ball given you picked from Bag 1)
# P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (3/5 * 0.5) + (2/5 * 0.5) = 0.5 (Probability of picking a red ball)

P_A = 0.5
P_B_given_A = 3/5
P_B = 0.5

P_A_given_B = (P_B_given_A * P_A) / P_B
print(f"Probability of picking from Bag 1 given you picked a red ball: {P_A_given_B}") # Output: Probability of picking from Bag 1 given you picked a red ball: 0.6
```

### 3.2 Descriptive Statistics with Python

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35]

# Using NumPy
mean = np.mean(data)
median = np.median(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)
variance = np.var(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean}")       # Output: Mean: 21.5
print(f"Median: {median}")     # Output: Median: 21.0
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}") # Output: Standard Deviation: 7.602631101374048
print(f"Variance: {variance}")   # Output: Variance: 57.85

# Using Pandas
data_series = pd.Series(data)
descriptive_stats = data_series.describe()
print("\nDescriptive Statistics using Pandas:")
print(descriptive_stats)
#Output
# Descriptive Statistics using Pandas:
# count    10.000000
# mean     21.500000
# std       7.993054
# min      10.000000
# 25%      15.750000
# 50%      21.000000
# 75%      27.250000
# max      35.000000
# dtype: float64
```

### 3.3 Hypothesis Testing

**Example: T-Test**

We want to test if the average height of students in a school is significantly different from 170 cm. We have a sample of student heights.

```python
from scipy import stats

# Sample data
heights = [165, 172, 175, 168, 170, 173, 171, 169, 174, 172]

# Perform a one-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(heights, 170)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic}")  # Output: T-statistic: 0.6078032603049407
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")      # Output: P-value: 0.5576393056904357

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The average height is significantly different from 170 cm.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the average height is significantly different from 170 cm.") # Output: Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the average height is significantly different from 170 cm.
```

**Explanation:**

*   `stats.ttest_1samp(heights, 170)` performs a one-sample t-test to compare the sample mean to the hypothesized population mean (170 cm).
*   The `p-value` represents the probability of observing the sample data if the null hypothesis (average height is 170 cm) is true.
*   If the `p-value` is less than the significance level (`alpha`), we reject the null hypothesis.

### 3.4 Common Use Cases

*   **A/B Testing:** Determining which version of a website or app performs better.
*   **Medical Research:** Evaluating the effectiveness of new treatments.
*   **Finance:** Assessing investment risks and predicting market trends.
*   **Quality Control:** Monitoring the quality of products and processes.
*   **Machine Learning:** Building predictive models and evaluating their performance.

### 3.5 Best Practices

*   **Data Cleaning:** Ensure data is accurate and consistent before analysis.
*   **Data Visualization:** Use appropriate visualizations to explore data and communicate findings.
*   **Statistical Software:** Utilize statistical software packages like Python (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and Statsmodels) or R to automate calculations and analysis.

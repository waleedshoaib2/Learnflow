### Step-by-Step Examples

- **Example 1: [Specific task/project description]**
    1. **Step 1:** [Detailed explanation of the step]

    2. **Step 2:** [Detailed explanation of the step]
       ```[language]
       # Code snippet for Step 2
       def add(x, y):
           return x + y
       ```
       Explanation: [Explanation of the code snippet]
    3. ... [Continue with the remaining steps]

- **Example 2: [Specific task/project description]**
    1. **Step 1:** [Detailed explanation of the step]
       ```[language]
       # Code snippet for Step 1
       ```
       Explanation: [Explanation of the code snippet]
    2. ... [Continue with the remaining steps]

### Code Snippets with Explanations

[Provide additional code snippets that illustrate specific concepts or techniques.  Be sure to explain the purpose and functionality of each snippet.]

```[language]
# Example of [Specific functionality, e.g., "a function to calculate the factorial of a number"]
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

Explanation: The `factorial` function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.

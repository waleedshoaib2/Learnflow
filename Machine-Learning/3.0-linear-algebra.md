## 2. Core Concepts

### Key Theoretical Foundations

Linear algebra revolves around the concepts of **vector spaces** and **linear transformations**.

- **Vector Space:** A vector space is a set of objects (vectors) that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real numbers or complex numbers) while still remaining within the set.  Examples include the set of all n-tuples of real numbers (R<sup>n</sup>) and the set of all polynomials.

- **Linear Transformation:** A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, if T is a linear transformation, then T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cu) = cT(u) for all vectors u, v and scalar c.

### Important Terminology

- **Vector:** A quantity with both magnitude and direction.  Represented as a column or row of numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` or `[[1], [2], [3]]`).

- **Matrix:** A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.  (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`).

- **Scalar:** A single number, often used to multiply vectors or matrices.

- **Transpose:**  A matrix formed by swapping the rows and columns of the original matrix. Denoted by A<sup>T</sup>.

- **Identity Matrix:** A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Denoted by I.  When multiplied by any matrix A, results in A (i.e., AI = A).

- **Inverse Matrix:** A matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. Denoted by A<sup>-1</sup>. Only square matrices can have inverses. (i.e., AA<sup>-1</sup> = I)

- **Determinant:** A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.  Indicates whether the matrix is invertible.

- **Eigenvalue:** A scalar λ such that for a given matrix A, there exists a non-zero vector v (eigenvector) that satisfies Av = λv.

- **Eigenvector:** A non-zero vector v such that for a given matrix A, Av = λv, where λ is an eigenvalue.

### Fundamental Principles

- **Vector Addition:** Add corresponding components of vectors.

  ```
  [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [1+3, 2+4] = [4, 6]
  ```

- **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiply each component of a vector by the scalar.

  ```
  2 * [1, 2] = [2*1, 2*2] = [2, 4]
  ```

- **Matrix Multiplication:** The element in the i-th row and j-th column of the product of matrices A and B is the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.  For A (m x n) and B (n x p), the result C (m x p) has C<sub>ij</sub> = Σ<sub>k=1</sub><sup>n</sup> A<sub>ik</sub>B<sub>kj</sub>.

- **Solving Linear Equations:** Use methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion to find the solution to systems of linear equations (e.g., Ax = b).

### Visual Explanations

Vectors can be visualized as arrows in a coordinate system.  For example, a 2D vector [3, 2] can be drawn as an arrow starting from the origin (0, 0) and ending at the point (3, 2).

Linear transformations can be visualized as geometric operations that stretch, rotate, shear, or reflect vectors. For example, a rotation matrix rotates vectors around the origin.

## 3. Practical Implementation

### Step-by-Step Examples

Let's illustrate some basic linear algebra operations using Python and the `NumPy` library.

**1. Creating Vectors and Matrices:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a vector
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Vector:", vector)

# Creating a matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("Matrix:\n", matrix)
```

**2. Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Vector addition
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
vector_sum = vector1 + vector2
print("Vector Sum:", vector_sum)

# Scalar multiplication
scalar = 2
scaled_vector = scalar * vector1
print("Scaled Vector:", scaled_vector)
```

**3. Matrix Multiplication:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Matrix multiplication
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
matrix_product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2) # or matrix1 @ matrix2 in newer versions
print("Matrix Product:\n", matrix_product)
```

**4. Transpose:**

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
transpose_matrix = matrix.T
print("Transpose Matrix:\n", transpose_matrix)
```

**5. Inverse Matrix:**

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
try:
    inverse_matrix = np.linalg.inv(matrix)
    print("Inverse Matrix:\n", inverse_matrix)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("Matrix is not invertible")
```

**6. Solving a System of Linear Equations:**

Consider the system:

```
x + 2y = 5
3x + 4y = 11
```

In matrix form, Ax = b where:

A = `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
x = `[[x], [y]]`
b = `[[5], [11]]`

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([5, 11])

x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
print("Solution:", x)
```

## 4. Advanced Topics

### Advanced Techniques

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal important information about the behavior of linear transformations. They are used in PCA, spectral clustering, and vibration analysis.
   - Eigenvectors remain in the same direction after a linear transformation, only scaled by the eigenvalue.
   - Calculation involves solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0 for eigenvalues, and then solving (A - λI)v = 0 for the corresponding eigenvectors.

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, and V<sup>T</sup>. It is used for dimensionality reduction, image compression, and recommendation systems.
   -  A = UΣV<sup>T</sup>
   - U and V are orthogonal matrices, and Σ is a diagonal matrix with singular values.

- **LU Decomposition:** Decomposes a matrix A into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). It is used to solve systems of linear equations and compute determinants.

### Real-World Applications

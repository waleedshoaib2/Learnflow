## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Key Theoretical Foundations

Python's core principles are based on the Zen of Python, which emphasizes readability, simplicity, and explicitness. The `import this` command in the Python interpreter reveals these guiding principles.

Key concepts include:

- **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is checked at runtime rather than at compile time.
- **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making code more readable and structured.
- **Garbage Collection:** Python automatically manages memory through garbage collection, freeing developers from manual memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Python supports OOP, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code.

### 2.2 Important Terminology

- **Variable:** A name that refers to a value.
- **Data Type:** A classification of data, such as integer, float, string, or boolean.
- **Operator:** A symbol that performs an operation on one or more values.
- **Statement:** A line of code that performs an action.
- **Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Module:** A file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs.
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object:** An instance of a class.
- **Exception:** An error that occurs during program execution.

### 2.3 Fundamental Principles

- **Data Types:** Understanding how to use `integers`, `floats`, `strings`, `lists`, `tuples`, `dictionaries`, and `sets`.
- **Control Flow:** Mastering `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
- **Functions:** Defining and calling functions to organize and reuse code.
- **Modules:** Importing and using modules to extend Python's functionality.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Creating classes and objects to model real-world entities.
- **Exception Handling:** Using `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

### 2.4 Visual Explanations

Consider a variable like a container holding a value. The type of the container determines what kind of value it can hold (e.g., numbers, text).

```python
# Example of a variable and its type
x = 10  # x is an integer variable
print(x)
print(type(x))

name = "Alice"  # name is a string variable
print(name)
print(type(name))
```

A function is like a machine that takes inputs, processes them, and produces outputs.

```python
# Example of a function
def add(a, b):
  """This function adds two numbers."""
  return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

## 3. Practical Implementation

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Examples

#### 3.1.1 Hello, World!

The classic first program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 3.1.2 Variables and Data Types

```python
# Integer
age = 30
print(f"Age: {age}, Type: {type(age)}")

# Float
price = 99.99
print(f"Price: {price}, Type: {type(price)}")

# String
name = "Bob"
print(f"Name: {name}, Type: {type(name)}")

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(f"Is student: {is_student}, Type: {type(is_student)}")

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Numbers: {numbers}, Type: {type(numbers)}")

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}, Type: {type(coordinates)}")

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
print(f"Person: {person}, Type: {type(person)}")
```

#### 3.1.3 Conditional Statements

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
  print("You are an adult.")
else:
  print("You are a minor.")

# Using elif
score = 85

if score >= 90:
  print("A")
elif score >= 80:
  print("B")
elif score >= 70:
  print("C")
else:
  print("D")
```

#### 3.1.4 Loops

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
  print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
  print(count)
  count += 1
```

#### 3.1.5 Functions

```python
def greet(name):
  """Greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("David")

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

result = add(10, 5)
print(result)
```

#### 3.1.6 Modules

```python
# Importing the math module
import math

# Using the sqrt function
square_root = math.sqrt(16)
print(square_root)

# Importing specific functions
from math import pi, sin

print(pi)
print(sin(0))
```

#### 3.1.7 Exception Handling

```python
try:
  result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
  print("Execution complete.")
```

#### 3.1.8 Working with lists

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4) # Adds 4 to the end of the list
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

my_list.insert(0, 0) # Inserts 0 at the beginning of the list
print(my_list) # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

del my_list[0] #Deletes the first element in the list
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

popped_value = my_list.pop() #Removes and returns the last element
print(my_list) #Output [1, 2, 3]
print(popped_value) # Output: 4
```

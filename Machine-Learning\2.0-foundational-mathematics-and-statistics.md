## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. Mathematics

#### 2.1.1. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It forms the basis for many machine learning algorithms.

*   **Vectors:** Ordered arrays of numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
*   **Matrices:** Two-dimensional arrays of numbers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`).
*   **Scalar:** A single number.
*   **Vector Addition:** Adding corresponding elements of two vectors.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying each element of a vector by a scalar.
*   **Matrix Multiplication:** A more complex operation defined for compatible matrices.  Important for transformations.
*   **Transpose:** Swapping rows and columns of a matrix.
*   **Inverse:**  A matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix (if it exists).
*   **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** Eigenvectors remain in the same direction after a linear transformation, and eigenvalues are the factor by which they are scaled. Crucial for dimensionality reduction.

> **Note:** Understanding linear algebra is crucial for understanding dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and SVD, as well as the inner workings of neural networks.

#### 2.1.2. Calculus

Calculus deals with rates of change and accumulation. It is essential for optimization and understanding the behavior of functions.

*   **Functions:** A relationship between inputs and outputs (e.g., `f(x) = x^2`).
*   **Limits:** The value a function approaches as the input approaches some value.
*   **Derivatives:** The rate of change of a function at a given point. Used to find maximum and minimum values (optimization).
*   **Integrals:** The area under a curve. Used for calculating probabilities and expected values.
*   **Gradient:** A vector of partial derivatives.  Points in the direction of the steepest ascent of a function. Fundamental in training machine learning models.

### 2.2. Statistics

#### 2.2.1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

*   **Mean:** The average value.
*   **Median:** The middle value when the data is sorted.
*   **Mode:** The most frequent value.
*   **Variance:** A measure of how spread out the data is.
*   **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance.
*   **Percentiles:** Values below which a given percentage of observations fall.
*   **Histograms:** Visual representation of the distribution of data.

#### 2.2.2. Probability

Probability deals with the likelihood of events occurring.

*   **Probability:** A number between 0 and 1 representing the likelihood of an event.
*   **Random Variable:** A variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.
*   **Probability Distribution:** A function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable.
*   **Expected Value:** The average value of a random variable.
*   **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event given that another event has occurred. `P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)`
*   **Bayes' Theorem:** A fundamental theorem that describes how to update beliefs based on new evidence. `P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)`

#### 2.2.3. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics uses sample data to make inferences about a larger population.

*   **Hypothesis Testing:** A method for testing a claim about a population.
*   **Null Hypothesis:** A statement about the population that we are trying to disprove.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.
*   **p-value:** The probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
*   **Confidence Intervals:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter.
*   **Regression Analysis:** A statistical method for modeling the relationship between variables.

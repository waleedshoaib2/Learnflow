## 3. Practical Implementation

### Step-by-Step Examples

Let's consider a simple example: calculating the sum of a large array using multiple processors.

**Sequential Approach (Single Processor):**

```python
def sequential_sum(arr):
  """Calculates the sum of an array sequentially."""
  total = 0
  for num in arr:
    total += num
  return total

# Example usage:
data = list(range(1000000))
result = sequential_sum(data)
print(f"Sequential sum: {result}")
```

**Parallel Approach (Using Python's `multiprocessing` module):**

```python
import multiprocessing

def parallel_sum(arr, num_processes):
    """Calculates the sum of an array in parallel using multiprocessing."""
    chunk_size = len(arr) // num_processes
    processes = []
    results = multiprocessing.Queue()

    def worker(arr_chunk, results_queue):
        chunk_sum = sum(arr_chunk)
        results_queue.put(chunk_sum)

    for i in range(num_processes):
        start = i * chunk_size
        end = (i + 1) * chunk_size if i < num_processes - 1 else len(arr)
        chunk = arr[start:end]
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(chunk, results))
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    total_sum = 0
    while not results.empty():
        total_sum += results.get()

    return total_sum

# Example usage:
data = list(range(1000000))
num_processes = 4  # Number of processors to use
result = parallel_sum(data, num_processes)
print(f"Parallel sum: {result}")
```

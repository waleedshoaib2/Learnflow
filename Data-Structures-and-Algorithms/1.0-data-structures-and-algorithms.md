## 2. Core Concepts

### Key Theoretical Foundations

At its core, DSA relies on a few fundamental concepts:

*   **Data Structure:** A way of organizing and storing data to facilitate efficient access and modification.  Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
*   **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure or set of instructions for solving a specific problem. Examples include searching, sorting, graph traversal, and optimization.
*   **Abstraction:**  Hiding the underlying implementation details of a data structure or algorithm, providing a simplified interface for users. This is a key principle of object-oriented programming and modular design.
*   **Time Complexity:**  A measure of how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.  Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)).
*   **Space Complexity:** A measure of how much memory an algorithm requires as the input size increases. Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(1)).

### Important Terminology

*   **Abstract Data Type (ADT):** A theoretical concept that defines a data type's behavior independently of its implementation.  For example, a `List` ADT specifies operations like `add`, `remove`, and `get`, without specifying how the list is stored in memory.
*   **Big O Notation:** A mathematical notation used to describe the asymptotic behavior of an algorithm, especially its time and space complexity. Examples: O(1) - constant time, O(log n) - logarithmic time, O(n) - linear time, O(n log n) - linearithmic time, O(n^2) - quadratic time, O(2^n) - exponential time.
*   **Recursion:** A technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.  Essential for algorithms like quicksort and tree traversals.
*   **Iteration:**  A technique where a block of code is executed repeatedly until a certain condition is met (e.g., using `for` or `while` loops).
*   **Sorting:** Arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).  Examples: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
*   **Searching:** Finding a specific element within a data structure. Examples: Linear Search, Binary Search.
*   **Graph Traversal:**  Visiting all the vertices in a graph in a systematic way. Examples: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).

### Fundamental Principles

*   **Divide and Conquer:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving the subproblems recursively, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
*   **Greedy Algorithm:** Making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Examples: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Huffman Coding.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Solving overlapping subproblems by storing the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem.

### Visual Explanations

#### Array:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 5 | 2 | 8 | 3 |
+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4  (Index)
```

An array is a contiguous block of memory used to store elements of the same data type. Accessing an element by its index is an O(1) operation.

#### Linked List:

```
+-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
| Data | --> | Data | --> | Data | --> | Data | --> NULL
| Next |    | Next |    | Next |    | Next |
+-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
```

A linked list consists of nodes, each containing data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node.  Insertion and deletion at the beginning or end are efficient, but accessing an element by index requires traversing the list.

#### Binary Search Tree:

```
      4
     / \
    2   6
   / \ / \
  1  3 5  7
```

A binary search tree is a tree-based data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).  The left child of a node always has a value less than the node's value, and the right child always has a value greater than the node's value.  Efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion.

## 3. Practical Implementation

### Step-by-Step Examples

Let's implement a few basic data structures and algorithms in Python.

**1. Array Implementation (Python List):**

```python
# Python lists are dynamic arrays

my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing an element
print(my_array[0])  # Output: 1

# Appending an element
my_array.append(6)
print(my_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Inserting an element at a specific index
my_array.insert(2, 10)
print(my_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Deleting an element
my_array.remove(10)
print(my_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**2. Linked List Implementation:**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return

        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node:
            print(current_node.data, end=" -> ")
            current_node = current_node.next
        print("None")

# Example Usage
my_list = LinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
my_list.print_list() # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
```

**3. Binary Search Implementation:**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found at index mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half

    return -1  # Target not found

# Example Usage
sorted_array = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target_value = 13
index = binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)

if index != -1:
    print(f"Target {target_value} found at index {index}")
else:
    print(f"Target {target_value} not found in the array")
```

### Best Practices

*   **Choose the right data structure:**  Consider the operations you need to perform and the efficiency requirements. For example, if you need to frequently insert and delete elements at arbitrary positions, a linked list might be better than an array.
*   **Understand time and space complexity:** Analyze the performance of your algorithms to ensure they are efficient for the expected input size.

## 2. Core Concepts

### Key Theoretical Foundations

Deep learning models are built upon the foundation of artificial neural networks. A neural network consists of interconnected nodes called **neurons**, organized in layers.  These neurons perform simple mathematical operations on their inputs, and then pass the result to the next layer.

The foundational concepts that underpin deep learning are:

-   **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** The basic building block, inspired by the structure of the human brain.
-   **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Examples include:
    -   `Sigmoid`:  Outputs a value between 0 and 1.
        ```python
        import numpy as np

        def sigmoid(x):
            return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
        ```
    -   `ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)`: Outputs x if x is positive, 0 otherwise.  Generally preferred in modern deep learning architectures.
        ```python
        def relu(x):
            return np.maximum(0, x)
        ```
    -   `Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)`: Outputs a value between -1 and 1.
    -   `Softmax`:  Outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes.  Commonly used in the output layer of classification models.
-   **Loss Functions:** Quantify the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Common loss functions include:
    -   `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`: Used for regression problems.
    -   `Cross-Entropy Loss`: Used for classification problems.
-   **Optimization Algorithms:** Update the weights and biases of the network to minimize the loss function. Examples include:
    -   `Gradient Descent`: Iteratively adjusts the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.
    -   `Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)`: Updates the parameters using a single data point or a small batch of data points.
    -   `Adam`: An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
-   **Backpropagation:**  An algorithm to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters.  This algorithm is crucial for efficiently training deep neural networks.

### Important Terminology

-   **Weight:**  A parameter associated with each connection between neurons, representing the strength of the connection.
-   **Bias:**  An additional parameter added to each neuron to shift the activation function.
-   **Layer:** A collection of neurons that perform a similar operation.
    -   **Input Layer:** Receives the input data.
    -   **Hidden Layer:** Layers between the input and output layers. Deep learning networks have multiple hidden layers.
    -   **Output Layer:** Produces the final output.
-   **Deep Neural Network (DNN):**  A neural network with multiple hidden layers.

-   **Regularization:** Techniques used to prevent overfitting, such as L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.

### Fundamental Principles

The core principle behind deep learning is to learn hierarchical representations of data. Each layer in a deep neural network learns increasingly complex features from the previous layer. For example, in image recognition, the first layer might learn to detect edges, the second layer might learn to combine edges into shapes, and the third layer might learn to combine shapes into objects.

The process of training a deep learning model involves:

1.  **Forward Propagation:** The input data is fed forward through the network to produce an output.
2.  **Loss Calculation:** The loss function is used to calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual output.
3.  **Backpropagation:** The gradients of the loss function are calculated with respect to the network's parameters.
4.  **Parameter Update:** The optimization algorithm is used to update the network's parameters to minimize the loss function.

## 3. Practical Implementation

### Step-by-step examples

Let's create a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

1.  **Import Libraries:**

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    import numpy as np
    ```

2.  **Load and Prepare the Data:**

    ```python
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

    # Normalize the data
    x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
    x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

    # Flatten the images
    x_train = x_train.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))
    x_test = x_test.reshape((10000, 28 * 28))

    # Convert labels to categorical data
    y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
    y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
    ```

3.  **Define the Model:**

    ```python
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(28 * 28,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    ```
    This defines a simple model with one hidden layer containing 128 neurons using the `ReLU` activation function, and an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using the `softmax` activation function.  The `input_shape` parameter specifies the shape of the input data.

4.  **Compile the Model:**

    ```python
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```
    This configures the learning process.  `optimizer='adam'` specifies the Adam optimization algorithm. `loss='categorical_crossentropy'` specifies the loss function.  `metrics=['accuracy']` specifies the metric to be evaluated during training.

5.  **Train the Model:**

    ```python
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)
    ```
    This trains the model on the training data for 2 epochs, using a batch size of 32.

6.  **Evaluate the Model:**

    ```python
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
    print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
    ```
    This evaluates the trained model on the test data.

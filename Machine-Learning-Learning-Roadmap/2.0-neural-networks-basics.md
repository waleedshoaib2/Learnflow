The tutorial is structured to provide a clear learning path with hands-on exercises to reinforce understanding.

**Why it's important:** Neural networks are the foundation of modern deep learning and are used in a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, robotics, and more. Understanding the basics of neural networks is crucial for anyone interested in these fields.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Basic understanding of Python programming.
*   Familiarity with linear algebra (vectors, matrices).
*   Basic calculus (derivatives).

**Learning objectives:**
*   Understand the basic architecture of a neural network.
*   Learn the key components: neurons, weights, biases, activation functions.
*   Implement a simple neural network from scratch.
*   Grasp the concepts of forward propagation and backpropagation.
*   Understand the role of loss functions and optimization algorithms.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Key Theoretical Foundations

At its core, a **neural network** is a collection of interconnected nodes called **neurons** organized in layers. These networks are designed to mimic the way the human brain works, enabling them to learn complex patterns from data.

*   **Neurons:** The basic building block of a neural network. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and produces an output.
*   **Layers:**  Neurons are organized into layers.  The typical neural network has an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers**, and an **output layer**.
*   **Weights:** Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection.
*   **Biases:** Each neuron has a bias, which is added to the weighted sum of inputs to adjust the activation threshold.
*   **Activation Functions:**  A function that introduces non-linearity to the output of a neuron.  Common activation functions include `sigmoid`, `ReLU`, `tanh`, and `softmax`.

### 2.2 Important Terminology

*   **Input Layer:** The first layer in a neural network. It receives the input data.
*   **Hidden Layer:** Layers between the input and output layers. These layers perform complex feature extraction.
*   **Output Layer:** The final layer that produces the output of the network.
*   **Forward Propagation:** The process of passing input data through the network from the input layer to the output layer.
*   **Backpropagation:** The process of calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and updating the weights and biases to minimize the loss.
*   **Loss Function:** A function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.
*   **Optimization Algorithm:** An algorithm used to update the weights and biases of the network to minimize the loss function.  Examples include `Gradient Descent`, `Adam`, and `RMSprop`.
*   **Epoch:** One complete pass through the entire training dataset.
*   **Batch Size:** The number of training examples used in one iteration of the optimization algorithm.
*   **Learning Rate:**  A hyperparameter that controls the step size of the optimization algorithm.

### 2.3 Fundamental Principles

The fundamental principle behind neural networks is to learn the optimal weights and biases that minimize the loss function. This is achieved through an iterative process of forward propagation and backpropagation.

1.  **Forward Propagation:** The input data is fed through the network, with each neuron applying its weights, biases, and activation function to produce an output. This process continues until the output layer is reached.

2.  **Loss Calculation:** The loss function compares the predicted output with the actual output, providing a measure of the network's performance.

3.  **Backpropagation:**  The gradients of the loss function are calculated with respect to each weight and bias. This information is then used to update the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the gradient, effectively reducing the loss.

4.  **Optimization:** The optimization algorithm uses the gradients to update the weights and biases. This process is repeated for multiple epochs until the network's performance converges.

### 2.4 Visual Explanation
